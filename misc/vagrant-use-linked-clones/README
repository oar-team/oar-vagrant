Hello,

I just wrote a proof of concept wrapper script around VBoxManage, to force vagrant to use linked clones, instead of importing a vagrant box as a new VM every time.

The script is here:
https://gist.github.com/npf/6b6ff2a0f5f2b8a2b8d4

It can be placed here ~/.vagrant.d/bin/VBoxManage

Using it is just the matter of exporting PATH=~/.vagrant.d/bin:$PATH and vagrant up will first import the box in VirtualBox as a golden box if not done previously, then snapshot that box and "link-clone" it for every new VMs that request the same vagrant box.
Seems to works quite well.
For sure, doing it in Vagrant code (ruby) would be a better place I guess.

Hope this helps
Pierre
