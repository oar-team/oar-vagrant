===========

Using Vagrant to test OAR's different flavors of installation

See: http://oar.imag.fr/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:oar-vagrant

To increase the number of nodes in your virtual cluster (only 1 by default), edit the Vagrantfile and change the HOST_COUNTS variable
(be careful, vagrant is greedy on disk space :-( ).
